# what is chess clock?
A chess clock is a device that is used to measure the time taken by each player during a game of chess. It consists of two adjacent clocks with buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, so that the two clocks never run simultaneously. Chess clocks are used in chess and other two-player games where the players move in turn, and in some legal settings where each side is allotted a specific amount of time for arguments
